* Cloned [my forked repo](https://github.com/smr547/cam86_fw) to local Raspberry Pi computer ``/home/smr/projects/cam86_fw``
* [Loaded the AVR toolchain](https://github.com/NicoHood/NicoHood.github.io/wiki/How-to-(cross-)compile-AVR-programs-with-Raspberry-Pi)
* Read [tutorial on AVR firmware programming](https://davecturner.github.io/2019/02/23/programming-avr-microcontrollers.html)
