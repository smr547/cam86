# cam86 Hardware

## Design
* [Circuit schematic](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B33NUzWf6odbX0hPSF9yLTQtb0E/view)
* see [key components](key_components.md)
* The designers publish [Gerber Files](http://astroccd.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Gerber-CAM86.zip) (for the production of PCBs), however
* I've been unable to find the underlying CAD files that would encourage "home grown" modifications

## PCB 

* The current challenge is to get a PCB to build the camera
* I plan to use [OSH Park](https://oshpark.com) to supply the PCB using a supplied Gerber zip file (see below)
* I'd also like to find [KiCad](https://kicad-pcb.org/) source file so that the PCB can be modified if necessary

## CCDs vs CMOS detectors
